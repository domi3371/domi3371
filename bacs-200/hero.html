        Real life heroes are hard to come by, but there are a few people that have left generational effects pushing us all in a positive direction. Maya Angelou is whom I view as a modern day hero because of her unbending integrity and willingness to express herself on issues that tend to be pushed aside.

        Maya filled many roles in the 86 years we had her with us:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A civil rights activist - working along side Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X.</li>
        <li>A poet - having written "On the Pulse of Morning" </li>
        <li>Author - publishing "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Maya Angelou has become a grand role model that many women, regardelss of race or religion, can look up to with admiration. She left behing a legacy of empowered women who know that the work will pay off and the struggle doesn't forever. To me, that qualifies as being a hero.
