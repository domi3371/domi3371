    <h1>Amusingly Amusing</h1>
    <p>by Esthela Dominguez</p>

    <p>This page's sole purpose is to share some websites that I've found funny and entertaining.</p>

    <h2>Is DMX In Jail</h2>
    <p>Have you been wondering if DMX, the famous rapper, is currently in jail? This site only features a picture of the rapper as the background and either "DMX is not in jail" or "DMX is in jail". It's a fairly straightforward website.</p>

    <h2>Geoguessr</h2>
    <p>Geoguessr is a fun game that utilizes google maps to drop you off anywhere on Earth. You can either explore at your leisure or compete to find locations as challenge rounds. It's a great way to pass the time and see the world from the comfort of your couch.</p>

    <h2>Presidential Ham</h2>
    <p>This site depicts artistic renderings of all the United States President with ham in their arms. It's odd, but entertaining and slightly charming.</p>
