        <li>Is it possible to fake it until you make it? Amy Cuddy speaks on how our body language may not just be a reflection of our minds, but also a beginning to new self confidence. We have the ability to shape ourselves into better versions of ourselves with just a pose. </li>

    <h3>Lucinda Beaman - What Does It Take To Change A Mind?</h3>

        <li>Changing our minds is no easy matter. We'd need to vulnerable, learn, and truly understand why we might be wrong on a matter in order to even begin the process of changing our minds. However, becoming more open minded can lead us to a better, healthier society.</li>

    <h3>Bren√© Brown - The Power of Vulnerability</h3>

    <p>
        <li>Connections are integral to human life and society as a whole. We all wish to be loved, appreciated, and needed just as much as we love, appreciate, and need others to feel complete. However, those that feel unworthy of such connections may be pusing other away out of fear and shame. </li>

    <h3>Renata Salecl - The Paradox of Choice</h3>

        <li>Having a vast amount of options to choose from could add some sort of freedom to our lives, but too much choice can actually cause us to build up limits unconciously. The lindering thoughts of forgoing a different option hinders our lives and choice could begin to lose all meaning. </li>
