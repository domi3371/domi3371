<h1 class="display-3 border border-info text-danger bg-dark p-1 text-center rounded-pill font-weight-bold text-center text-info"> Social Media and Extremism </h1>
<p class="font-light lead text-center p-5">Radicalization is a process that social media can amplify. It can start with a desire to be heard and to have your voice acknowledged, but it can quickly evolve into violence and threats towards ceratin groups. Now the question comes down to who should be held responsible when extremeist groups that felt empowered through social media actually carry out those threats. </p>

    "Yet, even as the body count of this fanaticism grows, the nation still lacks a coherent strategy for countering the violent extremism made possible through the internet."

    <h2 class="display-4 border border-danger text-danger bg-secondary p-2 text-center rounded-pill font-weight-normal">Social Implication</h2>
    <p class="font-light lead text-center p-5"> Hate can spread like wildfire with almost no effort. As platforms like Facebook and Twitter are free for anyone to use, it's difficult to monitor user interactions that raise concern. When the El Paso shooter shared his manifesto on 8chan, it was quickly circulating other platforms as well. Readers became radicalized and agreed with his dangerous message. Social media platforms aren't prepared to deal with radicalized users spreading hate and false information.Censorship isn't required on these platforms either, resulting in a rift between users with differing views. It becomes a daily debate on basic human rights and decency that causes tension amongst fellow users. </p>

    <h2 class="display-4 border border-danger text-danger bg-secondary p-2 text-center rounded-pill  font-weight-normal">Political Implications</h2>
    <p class="font-light lead text-center p-5"> A group that's often associated with extremism in the United States is White Nationalist as they have many public forums and share their views through social media. Politicians have now been forced to acknowledge the issue of extremism because of terrorist threats on specific religion and ethnic groups. Now, many politicians are focusing their campaigns on how to address these homeland terrorist groups that are being empowered through social media. A major point to address is when can the government intervene and infringe upon free speech online? Many say that once threats are being made and individuals feel attacked, then the government should be able to act, but others are admitted the government should stay out and leave it to social media companies to address.</p>

    <h2 class="display-4 border border-danger text-danger bg-secondary p-2 text-center rounded-pill  font-weight-normal">Economic Implications</h2>
    <p class="font-light lead text-center p-5">Social media is free for anyone to access and utilize. Small businesses use social media for their main marketing efforts and spreading awareness of their brand. However, we now live in a very politically charged time, so businesses are expected to share their political viewpoints through social media as well. This can cause problems for businesses when extremists on their political side disagree with the company's stance on an issue resulting in boycotts and bad press. Cancel culture has become more prevalent with these political differences and at times it can result in positive change with company reforms. However, it can affect business owners that are targeted by extremist groups for harassment and the potential of being "canceled".</p>

    <h2 class="display-4 border border-danger text-danger bg-secondary p-2 text-center rounded-pill  font-weight-normal">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="font-light lead text-center p-5">
        Social media is a great tool for reaching new audiences and connecting with new people, however, it can have it's draw backs. Radicalization is spreads quickly and with almost no warning with platforms not being well equipped to combat it. Hate can corrupt many and hurt not only our relationships with people, but also our society as a whole. Now, we need social media platforms to acknowledge the challenge they have to face and hold them accountable for allowing users to harm others through the platforms. We need politicians to understand that words can lead to actions and actions can lead to horrific history. Social media is powerful and must be properly monitored to ensure no one is harmed or feels threatened for being who they are. </p>
